A server-driven UI library for Aeria, made with Vue.

```vue
<template>
  <h1>Pizzas</h1>
  <aeria-crud name="pizza" />
</template>
```

<br clear="left" />

<!-- ## Features -->

<!-- ### Minimalistically typed -->

<!-- A type-driven experience is provided with state-of-the-art TypeScript, no code generation required. Define your collection structure with a runtime JavaScript object then it's type will be made universally available, even to the frontend. -->

<!-- ### A more cohesive fullstack -->

<!-- Aeria makes your backend metadata fully available to the frontend with [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), allowing third parties to quickly grasp how your data should be rendered. The official counterpart library [Aeria UI]() makes possible to bring up a complete frontend for an Aeria backend within minutes. -->

<!-- ### Better error handling -->

<!-- Inspired by functional languages, Aeria makes use of the much safer and runtime efficient `Either` approach to error handling. Route callbacks have their exceptions handled by default, so your application won't crash if you miss a try/catch block. -->

<!-- ### Runtime safety -->

<!-- All input data is optionally validated using the same schemas used during collection definition. Role-based access control and security checks for [common security weaknesses](https://github.com/sonata-api/sonata-api/tree/master/packages/security) are also shipped to allow even those who are unfamiliar with AppSec to build safely. -->
